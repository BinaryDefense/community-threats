# Qakbot DLL Sideloading

This emulation plan uses a custom built loader DLL to sideload a patched Qakbot DLL. You should expect AV/EDR detections from this plan since it uses patched malware that only differs in a few bytes from the actual malware. There is no risk to your systems from this emulation plan and it is safe to run in production.

Additional information on the plan, including detailed detection engineering, can be found at https://scythe.io/threatthursday/
